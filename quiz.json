  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "What is the value of $x$ in the equation $2x + 3 = 11$?",
      "options": [
        "3",
        "4",
        "5",
        "6"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "To solve for $x$, first subtract 3 from both sides: $2x = 11 - 3$, which simplifies to $2x = 8$. Then, divide both sides by 2 to get $x = 4$.",
      "hint": "Try to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the equation."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "What is the integral of $f(x) = x^2$?",
      "options": [
        "$$ \\frac{x^3}{3} + C $$",
        "$$ 2x + C $$",
        "$$ x^3 + C $$",
        "$$ \\frac{x^2}{2} + C $$"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The power rule for integration states that the integral of $x^n$ is $$\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$. For $x^2$, this results in $$\\frac{x^3}{3} + C$$.",
      "hint": "Remember the power rule for integration: $$\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$."

      "text": "According to Newton's Second Law, what is the formula for force?",

        "$F = ma$",
        "$E = mc^2$",
        "$v = d/t$",
        "$P = IV$"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the force ($F$) acting on an object is equal to the mass ($m$) of the object multiplied by its acceleration ($a$).",
      "hint": "This law relates force, mass, and acceleration."
