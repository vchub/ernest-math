  "content": "## Understanding Motion\\n\\nKinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause them to move. \\n\\n### Key Concepts\\n\\n* **Displacement ($$\\Delta x$$)**: The change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity.\\n* **Velocity ($$v$$)**: The rate of change of displacement. Average velocity is calculated as $$v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$$.\\n* **Acceleration ($$a$$)**: The rate of change of velocity. \\n\\nOne of the most important equations you will use is for an object moving with constant acceleration:\\n\\n$$x(t) = x_0 + v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$$\\n\\n![Graph of position vs. time](https://i.imgur.com/3p2tL1d.png)\\n\\nThis equation allows you to predict the position of an object at any given time $$t$$.

          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "Average velocity is calculated as $$v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$$. Here, $$\\Delta x = 8 \\text{ m} - 2 \\text{ m} = 6 \\text{ m}$$ and $$\\Delta t = 3 \\text{ s}$$. So, $$v_{avg} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ m/s}$$.",

          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "The formula for final velocity with constant acceleration is $v(t) = v_0 + at$. Since the car starts from rest, $v_0 = 0$. Therefore, $v(5) = 0 + (4 \\text{ m/s}^2)(5 \\text{ s}) = 20 \\text{ m/s}$.",

          "explanation": "Use the formula $v_f = v_0 + gt$. Since the ball is dropped, $v_0 = 0$. So, $v_f = (9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2)(3 \\text{ s}) = 29.4 \\text{ m/s}$.",
