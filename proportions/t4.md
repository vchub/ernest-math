### **The Legend of the Coder's Sword: A Roblox Adventure**

Imagine you're playing your favorite Roblox adventure game. You've just discovered a secret quest: **The Legend of the Coder's Sword**. This sword is the most powerful item in the game, able to defeat any boss in a single hit! But you can't just find it... you have to craft it.

You find an ancient blueprint left behind by the game's creator. It has three parts.

#### **Part 1: Forging the Mystic Alloy (The Ratio Problem)**

The blueprint says the sword's blade must be made from a special **Mystic Alloy**. To create it, you need to mix two rare materials you've been collecting: **Magma Ore** and **Void Crystals**.

The recipe is very specific: you must mix them in a ratio of **2:5**. That means for every **2 parts** of Magma Ore, you need exactly **5 parts** of Void Crystals. Any other mixture and the alloy will crumble!

The blueprint says you need to forge a blade that weighs exactly **350 grams**.

**The Challenge:** How many grams of Magma Ore and Void Crystals do you need to melt together?

This is a proportion problem! Let's solve it just like in the guide:

1.  **Find the total parts:** The ratio is 2:5, so you have $2 + 5 = 7$ total parts in your alloy.
2.  **Find the weight of one part:** The total weight is 350g. So, one part weighs $350 \div 7 = 50$ grams.
3.  **Calculate the weight of each material:**
    - **Magma Ore** needs 2 parts: $2 \times 50 \text{g} = 100$ grams.
    - **Void Crystals** need 5 parts: $5 \times 50 \text{g} = 250$ grams.

You mix 100g of Magma Ore and 250g of Void Crystals, and _CLANG_! You've successfully forged the blade.

#### **Part 2: Journey to the Secret Forge (The Map Scale Problem)**

You have the blade, but you can't finish the sword at a normal anvil. The blueprint shows a map to the **Secret Forge**, hidden on a remote island in the game.

You pull out the map on your screen. In the corner, you see the **scale: 1 : 500,000**. This means 1 centimeter on your map represents 500,000 centimeters in the actual game world.

You take out a ruler and measure the distance on the map from your location to the Secret Forge. Itâ€™s **4 centimeters**.

**The Challenge:** How far do you _actually_ have to travel in the game, in kilometers?

Let's use proportions again:

1.  **Set up the proportion:** $\frac{1}{500,000} = \frac{4}{x}$
2.  **Find the real distance in centimeters:** $x = 4 \times 500,000 = 2,000,000$ cm.
3.  **Convert to kilometers:** This is the tricky part! Remember, there are 100,000 cm in 1 km.
    $2,000,000 \text{ cm} \div 100,000 = 20$ kilometers.

You need to sail your boat 20 km across the game's ocean to reach the forge.

#### **Part 3: Powering the Forge (The Percentage Problem)**

You arrive at the Secret Forge. It's cold and dark. A message pops up: "Forge power level is critical. It must be at 100% to finish the sword." You see a power generator that takes special **Energy Cells**.

You look in your inventory and find a bag of them. The generator's screen says: "**450 power units currently active. This is 30% of the total power needed.**"

**The Challenge:** How many total power units does the forge need?

This is a classic percentage problem that proportions can solve:

1.  **Set up the proportion:** Let $x$ be the total power needed (which is 100%). We know that 450 units is 30%.
    $\frac{450}{30} = \frac{x}{100}$
2.  **Solve for x:**
    $30 \times x = 450 \times 100$
    $30x = 45,000$
    $x = 45,000 \div 30 = 1500$ power units.

The forge needs a total of 1500 power units. You've got 450, so you still need to add $1500 - 450 = 1050$ more. You use your Energy Cells, the forge roars to life at 100%, and you assemble the Coder's Sword!
