Practice Problems

Use the distributive property to solve the following problems.

1.  40 _ 8 + 20 _ (-15)

2.  15 _ 12 - 45 _ 3

3.  56 _ 5 + 28 _ (-9)

4.  150 _ 6 + 75 _ (-11)

5.  33 _ 7 - 11 _ 20

6.  120 _ 4 + 60 _ (-8)

7.  48 _ 10 + (-16) _ 29

Hint: For each problem, look for a number that can be factored out of both terms. For example, in the first problem, notice that 40 is 20 \* 2.

Take your time and work through them carefully. Let me know if you want to check your answers when you're done!
